# Dynatrace Usability Extension

A Google chrome extension for greater usability of Dynatrace. Currently this extension provides two areas:

- Adds tags to entities in the problem details window
- Applies custom color for your tenant

## Installation

Download latest version of the extension from the [/releases] page and import it into your Chrome based browser. You might need to switch to Developer mode.

## Settings

Visit a Dynatrace SaaS or Managed tenant and click the browser extension icon in the browser top bar. Settings are independent for each tenant.

Add an API token with smartscape permissions to allow fetching of tag information. If desired, apply tag filter in form of a regular expression.

Choose custom color to be applied in the top bar. You don't need the API token to apply the custom color. For custom coloring of another tenant, please visit another tenant.
